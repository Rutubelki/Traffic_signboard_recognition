# Traffic_signboard_recognition
Overview
This project focuses on recognizing traffic signs using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained on the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark dataset from Kaggle and utilizes OpenCV and Python for image processing and recognition.

Project Structure
Run either one of .py files

Make sure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
OpenCV
TensorFlow or Keras
Numpy
Pandas

How to Use
Step 1: Prepare the Dataset
Download the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark dataset from Kaggle and place it in the /dataset directory.

Step 2: Train the Model
Run the ts(5).py script to train the CNN model on the dataset. This script will preprocess the data, train the model, and save the trained model in the /models directory.

You may need to adjust parameters such as dataset paths, model hyperparameters, and input/output settings in the script files.
